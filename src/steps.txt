1) Install material UI. Acts like bootstrap but in a more sophisticated way.
2) add cards component from material ui. No need to write a lot of css.
3) App.js is the only class based component which has ome initial states as data and country.
4) fetchdata is an asynchronous function that is only returning the data that we need
5) in countrypicker, once country is chosen it goes back to app.js
